üóìÔ∏è Week 5: OSINT & Reconnaissance Techniques
Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to OSINT

    Task: Learn the fundamentals of Open Source Intelligence.

    Description: I was introduced to the concept of OSINT‚Äîgathering publicly available data for cybersecurity purposes. I studied its legal and ethical use in reconnaissance for penetration testing and red teaming.

Day 2 ‚Äì Passive Information Gathering

    Task: Practice passive reconnaissance on domains and organizations.

    Description: I used tools like WHOIS, NSLookup, and crt.sh to gather domain info. Explored Google Dorking to find exposed files and misconfigured web pages. Practiced silently collecting data without alerting the target.

Day 3 ‚Äì Active Reconnaissance Techniques

    Task: Perform live scans and interaction-based recon.

    Description: Practiced using tools like Nmap, Netcat, and Shodan. I conducted port scanning, service enumeration, and fingerprinting of network devices. Learned the difference between stealth scans and aggressive scans.

Day 4 ‚Äì Social Media & Human-Focused Recon

    Task: Harvest information from social platforms and public directories.

    Description: I investigated how attackers use LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook to gather employee names, job roles, and contact info. Practiced using theHarvester and SpiderFoot to automate this process.

Day 5 ‚Äì Documenting Reconnaissance Results

    Task: Organize and report all gathered intelligence.

    Description: I compiled a structured OSINT report, listing all findings, IP ranges, emails, subdomains, exposed files, and metadata. This info is vital for planning future penetration attempts or red team operations.
