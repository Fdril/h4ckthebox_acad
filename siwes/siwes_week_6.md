🗓️ Week 6: Vulnerability Scanning & Mapping\
Day 1 – Introduction to Vulnerability Assessment

    Task: Understand what vulnerability scanning is and why it’s important.

    Description: I learned how vulnerability scanning helps identify potential weaknesses in systems before they are exploited. We compared manual assessments vs automated scans using tools.

Day 2 – Setting Up Vulnerability Scanning Tools

    Task: Install and configure scanning tools in a lab environment.

    Description: I worked with tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, and Nmap with vulnerability scripts. I learned how to scan for outdated software, exposed services, and known CVEs.

Day 3 – Scanning for Network & Web Vulnerabilities

    Task: Perform full system and application scans.

    Description: I practiced scanning internal and external targets, analyzing results like open ports, banner info, service versions, and web misconfigurations. I learned to interpret severity levels (low, medium, high, critical).

Day 4 – False Positives and Manual Verification

    Task: Validate automated scan results manually.

    Description: I reviewed scan results to identify false positives, then used manual methods to confirm actual vulnerabilities. This helped me understand the importance of human analysis in the scanning process.

Day 5 – Mapping Vulnerabilities to Exploits

    Task: Correlate identified vulnerabilities with potential exploits.

    Description: I used public exploit databases like Exploit-DB, Rapid7, and Metasploit to find known exploits for discovered vulnerabilities. I documented how attackers might weaponize these vulnerabilities.
