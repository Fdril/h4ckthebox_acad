🗓️ Week 17 – Network Pentesting (Internal & External)\
Day 1 – Introduction to Network Pentesting

    Task: Learn the difference between internal and external network assessments.

    Description: I studied how internal testing simulates attacks from within an organization, while external testing targets exposed services like web servers and VPNs from outside the network.

Day 2 – Network Scanning & Enumeration

    Task: Identify active hosts and open ports.

    Description: I used tools like Nmap and Masscan to perform host discovery, port scanning, and service enumeration. I documented banners, versions, and potential weak services.

Day 3 – Internal Network Exploitation

    Task: Simulate internal attacks from a compromised host.

    Description: I explored lateral movement and privilege escalation by targeting SMB shares, weak admin credentials, and misconfigured network services using CrackMapExec and Responder.

Day 4 – External Network Exploitation

    Task: Attempt to exploit public-facing services.

    Description: I used Metasploit, Dirsearch, and Nuclei to scan and test vulnerabilities on exposed systems, including outdated CMS, RDP brute-force, and CVE-based exploits.

Day 5 – Reporting & Risk Analysis

    Task: Document findings and recommend mitigations.

    Description: I compiled the internal and external vulnerabilities discovered and rated them by impact and likelihood. I provided basic remediation steps like patching and network segmentation.
