üóìÔ∏è Week 13 ‚Äì Active Directory Basics\
Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Active Directory

    Task: Understand the core concepts and components of Active Directory.

    Description: I studied the structure of Active Directory (AD) including domains, OUs (Organizational Units), trust relationships, and Group Policy Objects (GPOs). I explored how AD is used to manage users, groups, and computers in a Windows enterprise environment.

Day 2 ‚Äì Enumeration of AD Environment

    Task: Discover users, groups, and permissions in AD.

    Description: I used tools like BloodHound, Sharphound, and net commands to enumerate users, domain groups, computers, and trust paths. I also explored LDAP enumeration and mapped privilege escalation paths.

Day 3 ‚Äì Exploiting Misconfigurations in AD

    Task: Identify and exploit weaknesses in AD setups.

    Description: I exploited common misconfigurations such as Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, and Unconstrained Delegation. I used tools like Impacket, Rubeus, and Mimikatz to perform these attacks in a lab environment.

Day 4 ‚Äì Domain Controller Access Simulation

    Task: Simulate attack against the Domain Controller.

    Description: I simulated privilege escalation attacks to gain access to Domain Controller systems. I practiced DCSync, Pass-the-Hash, and Golden Ticket techniques in a safe test setup to understand how attackers compromise AD.

Day 5 ‚Äì Hardening & Defense Techniques

    Task: Explore ways to secure AD environments.

    Description: I reviewed Microsoft‚Äôs AD hardening best practices and implemented basic mitigations such as disabling unnecessary services, limiting admin privileges, and monitoring authentication logs. I also tested Sysmon and Group Policy changes for security enforcement.
