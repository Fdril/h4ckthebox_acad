🗓️ Week 9 – Exploitation Techniques (Web, OS, Network)

📅 Day 1 – Introduction to Exploitation
Task: Studied fundamentals of system and application exploitation.
Description:
I explored how attackers exploit software vulnerabilities, insecure configurations, and poor input validations. I reviewed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and understood how exploits are developed, categorized, and publicly shared through databases like ExploitDB.

📅 Day 2 – Web Exploitation (XSS, File Upload, LFI, SSTI)
Task: Practiced exploiting web application vulnerabilities.
Description:
Using platforms like DVWA and PortSwigger Web Security Academy, I practiced common web exploits such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Local File Inclusion (LFI), Unrestricted File Upload, and Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). These attacks were tested in isolated lab environments.

📅 Day 3 – Operating System Exploitation (Linux & Windows)
Task: Simulated exploitation of OS-level vulnerabilities.
Description:
I used Metasploit, Searchsploit, and manual techniques to exploit vulnerable services on both Linux and Windows. Attacks included exploiting Samba misconfigurations and EternalBlue (MS17-010). Post-exploitation involved system enumeration and privilege discovery.

📅 Day 4 – Network Exploitation
Task: Explored vulnerabilities in network services.
Description:
I scanned for open ports and services like FTP, SMB, and RDP using Nmap. I tested network vulnerabilities including SMBv1, FTP anonymous login, and remote code execution. I also used Netcat and CrackMapExec to interact with compromised services.

📅 Day 5 – Introduction to Custom Exploit Development
Task: Learned the basics of exploit writing.
Description:
I studied how to develop simple exploits using Python, focusing on buffer overflow principles. I also explored public PoCs on ExploitDB, analyzed how they work, and modified basic scripts for use in lab environments.
