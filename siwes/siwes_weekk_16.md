üóìÔ∏è Week 16 ‚Äì Wireless Network Pentesting\
Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Wireless Pentesting

    Task: Understand wireless network fundamentals and common threats.

    Description: I studied wireless protocols (802.11), encryption types (WEP, WPA/WPA2), and common wireless attacks like sniffing, spoofing, and deauthentication.

Day 2 ‚Äì Wireless Scanning & Monitoring

    Task: Identify and analyze nearby wireless networks.

    Description: I used tools like Airmon-ng, Airodump-ng, and Wireshark to monitor wireless traffic, detect active clients, and capture handshake packets.

Day 3 ‚Äì WPA/WPA2 Handshake Capture

    Task: Perform wireless attack simulations.

    Description: I captured WPA2 handshakes from test networks and attempted offline password cracking using Hashcat and Aircrack-ng with a wordlist.

Day 4 ‚Äì Wireless Attacks (Deauth, Evil Twin)

    Task: Practice offensive wireless tactics in a safe lab setup.

    Description: I performed a deauthentication attack to force reconnection and tested a basic Evil Twin attack using hostapd-wpe and WiFi-Pumpkin.

Day 5 ‚Äì Defense & Hardening

    Task: Learn how to secure wireless networks.

    Description: I explored best practices for securing wireless access points, including strong passphrases, disabling WPS, hiding SSIDs, and using enterprise-level authentication.
