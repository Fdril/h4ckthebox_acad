üóìÔ∏è Week 19 ‚Äì Linux & Windows System Hardening\
Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to System Hardening

    Task: Understand basic concepts of hardening systems.

    Description: I learned how to reduce system vulnerabilities by disabling unnecessary services, managing user permissions, and applying basic security configurations on Linux and Windows.

Day 2 ‚Äì Linux System Hardening

    Task: Apply hardening techniques to a Linux VM.

    Description: I disabled unused services, configured firewall rules (UFW), restricted root login via SSH, and applied file permission policies on the Linux test machine.

Day 3 ‚Äì Windows System Hardening

    Task: Perform hardening tasks on a Windows environment.

    Description: I configured Group Policy settings, disabled unused ports and services, applied user access control, and checked security baselines using Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit.

Day 4 ‚Äì Auditing and Logging

    Task: Enable and review system logs for audit purposes.

    Description: I activated logging services like auditd on Linux and Event Viewer on Windows. I practiced reviewing logs to detect anomalies or policy violations.

Day 5 ‚Äì Practical Lab and Review

    Task: Combine all hardening techniques in a simulated environment.

    Description: I created a checklist to harden both Linux and Windows systems and used tools like Lynis (Linux) and Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to evaluate the improvements.
