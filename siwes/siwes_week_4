üóìÔ∏è Week 4: Social Engineering Techniques
Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Social Engineering

    Task: Understand social engineering as a cyberattack vector

    Description: I studied how attackers manipulate human behavior to gain unauthorized access or information. I learned that phishing, vishing, and smishing are the most common techniques used.

Day 2 ‚Äì Types of Social Engineering Attacks

    Task: Identify and explain various social engineering attacks

    Description: I explored types such as baiting, pretexting, tailgating, and business email compromise (BEC). These methods are often combined with technical exploitation in real-world scenarios.

Day 3 ‚Äì Phishing Simulation Tools

    Task: Explore tools used in phishing campaigns

    Description: I practiced using open-source tools like GoPhish to simulate phishing attacks for testing purposes. I learned how attackers craft emails and clone login pages to harvest credentials.

Day 4 ‚Äì Defense Against Social Engineering

    Task: Study countermeasures and awareness strategies

    Description: I learned how organizations train employees to detect and report social engineering attempts. Tools like email filtering, security awareness training, and 2FA help mitigate risks.

Day 5 ‚Äì Real-world Case Study

    Task: Analyze a real-world social engineering attack

    Description: I reviewed a high-profile case (Twitter breach 2020) where attackers used social engineering on internal staff. I documented the tactics used and how they could have been prevented.
