üóìÔ∏è Week 15 ‚Äì Red Team Tactics & OPSEC\
Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Red Teaming

    Task: Learn about red team operations and objectives.

    Description: I studied how red teams simulate real-world attackers to test defenses, focusing on stealth, planning, and goal-based attacks rather than just exploitation.

Day 2 ‚Äì OPSEC (Operational Security) Basics

    Task: Understand how to avoid detection during operations.

    Description: I learned about maintaining anonymity, avoiding logs, and controlling exposure. I practiced basic OPSEC concepts like using staging servers and encrypted communication.

Day 3 ‚Äì Command & Control Techniques

    Task: Explore simple C2 frameworks.

    Description: I tested basic command-and-control techniques using MSF's meterpreter and learned how to maintain access and exfiltrate data in a stealthy way.

Day 4 ‚Äì Emulating Attacker Behavior

    Task: Simulate real-world adversarial actions.

    Description: I followed red team playbooks to simulate lateral movement, privilege checks, and safe data collection without detection, using low-noise commands and custom payloads.

Day 5 ‚Äì Report on Tactics Used

    Task: Summarize and reflect on red team practices.

    Description: I documented the tools, techniques, and procedures used during red team simulations and reviewed the effectiveness of OPSEC practices.
