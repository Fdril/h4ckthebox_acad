üóìÔ∏è Week 9 ‚Äì Exploitation Techniques (Web, OS, Network)  
Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Exploitation

    Task: Learn the fundamentals of system and application exploitation.

    Description: I studied how attackers exploit software bugs, insecure configurations, or poor validation logic to gain unauthorized access. I reviewed CVEs and how exploits are created and shared.

Day 2 ‚Äì Web Exploitation (XSS, File Upload, LFI, SSTI)

    Task: Practice web exploit techniques in vulnerable applications.

    Description: I exploited flaws like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Local File Inclusion (LFI), Unrestricted File Upload, and Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) using DVWA and PortSwigger Labs.

Day 3 ‚Äì OS Exploitation (Linux & Windows)

    Task: Simulate exploiting vulnerable services on operating systems.

    Description: I used Metasploit, Searchsploit, and manual techniques to exploit OS vulnerabilities like outdated Samba, EternalBlue, and SSH misconfigurations. I practiced post-exploit enumeration.

Day 4 ‚Äì Network Exploitation

    Task: Identify and exploit weaknesses in network services.

    Description: I scanned for open services (FTP, SMB, RDP) and tested for common exploits such as SMBv1, FTP anonymous login, and RCE on network devices. I used tools like Nmap NSE, CrackMapExec, and Netcat.

Day 5 ‚Äì Custom Exploit Development (Intro)

    Task: Understand the basics of writing exploits.

    Description: I studied the structure of exploits and how to create simple buffer overflow scripts using Python. I also used ExploitDB to analyze exploit PoCs and modified them for basic use in test environments.
