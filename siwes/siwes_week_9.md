Day 1 – Linux Command Line Basics

    Task: Practice basic Linux commands and navigation.

    Description: I worked on understanding the Linux file system hierarchy and practiced commands like ls, cd, pwd, cp, mv, and rm. I also explored command chaining and redirection using pipes (|) and >, <.

Day 2 – File and Directory Permissions

    Task: Understand file permissions and user roles.

    Description: I learned how Linux handles file permissions, ownership (chown), and access rights (chmod). I practiced changing file permissions and examined SUID, SGID, and sticky bits in real-world security contexts.

Day 3 – Process and Service Management

    Task: Monitor and manage system processes and services.

    Description: I studied system resource usage using ps, top, htop, kill, and nice. I also learned how to manage services with systemctl, view logs in /var/log, and identify suspicious or malicious processes.

Day 4 – User Management and Shell Scripting

    Task: Create users and write simple bash scripts.

    Description: I practiced creating/deleting users and assigning groups. I then wrote simple bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks such as backups and scanning directories for changes.

Day 5 – File Searching, Networking, and Logs

    Task: Search files and understand basic networking in Linux.

    Description: I used tools like grep, find, and locate for efficient searching. I practiced using ifconfig, netstat, ss, and ping for basic networking. I explored log files to identify login attempts and anomalies.
