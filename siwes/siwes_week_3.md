üóìÔ∏è Week 3: Penetration Testing Basics\
Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Penetration Testing

    Task: Understand the goals of penetration testing

    Description: I was introduced to penetration testing, a security assessment technique used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems and applications. The goal is to mimic real-world cyberattacks to help organizations strengthen their security.

Day 2 ‚Äì Scoping and Rules of Engagement

    Task: Learn scoping techniques and engagement boundaries

    Description: I learned about scoping in penetration tests. This includes defining what systems/IP addresses can be tested, methods allowed, time limits, and overall test boundaries. I also reviewed the Rules of Engagement (RoE), which set ethical and legal limits during an assessment.

Day 3 ‚Äì Types of Penetration Testing

    Task: Explore types and levels of pen tests

    Description: I studied different types of penetration testing: Black Box (no prior knowledge), White Box (full knowledge), and Gray Box (partial knowledge). Each type simulates a different threat scenario and testing perspective.

Day 4 ‚Äì OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

    Task: Practice OSINT techniques

    Description: I practiced collecting public information about a target organization through tools like Google Dorking, WHOIS lookup, Shodan, and LinkedIn scraping. This information is useful for mapping out attack surfaces in real-world pentests.

Day 5 ‚Äì Legal and Ethical Considerations

    Task: Understand the legal boundaries of ethical hacking

    Description: I explored the legal frameworks and ethical considerations surrounding penetration testing. Topics covered included consent, scope definition, data handling policies, and the difference between ethical hacking and cybercrime.
