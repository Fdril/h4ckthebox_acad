üóìÔ∏è Week 14 ‚Äì Bypassing AV, EDR, and Firewalls\
Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Bypassing Security Controls

    Task: Understand how antivirus (AV), endpoint detection and response (EDR), and firewalls work.

    Description: I was introduced to how attackers attempt to bypass AV and firewall protection by using obfuscation and evasion techniques. I also reviewed how these security systems operate.

Day 2 ‚Äì Antivirus Evasion

    Task: Practice bypassing antivirus detection.

    Description: I used tools like Msfvenom and Veil to generate and test payloads that avoid antivirus detection in lab environments.

Day 3 ‚Äì EDR Bypass Basics

    Task: Learn about bypassing EDR systems.

    Description: I studied the concept of using built-in Windows tools (LOLBins) and basic memory injection techniques to avoid detection by EDR solutions.

Day 4 ‚Äì Firewall Evasion

    Task: Simulate bypassing firewall restrictions.

    Description: I practiced using reverse shells and tunneling tools like Ngrok to bypass simple firewall restrictions in a test network.

Day 5 ‚Äì Recap and Documentation

    Task: Summarize and document all techniques practiced.

    Description: I wrote a summary of the techniques used during the week and documented what worked and what was detected in different scenarios.
