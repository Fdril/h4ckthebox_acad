üóìÔ∏è Week 7: Web Application Attacks (OWASP Top 10 ‚Äì Part 1)\
Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to OWASP Top 10

    Task: Understand the purpose and structure of OWASP Top 10.

    Description: I studied the OWASP Top 10, a list of the most critical web application security risks. I learned how it guides secure coding and vulnerability assessment. The top risks include Injection, Broken Authentication, and more.

Day 2 ‚Äì Injection Attacks (A01:2021)

    Task: Perform SQL injection and command injection in a test environment.

    Description: I used DVWA and TryHackMe labs to practice SQL Injection (SQLi). I learned how improper input validation allows attackers to extract or modify data in databases. Explored tools like sqlmap for automation.

Day 3 ‚Äì Broken Authentication (A02:2021)

    Task: Understand and simulate broken login/session flaws.

    Description: I tested for weak login mechanisms using Burp Suite to brute-force passwords and bypass login forms. Studied poor session management, lack of MFA, and predictable credentials.

Day 4 ‚Äì Sensitive Data Exposure (A03:2021)

    Task: Identify insecure data handling in web apps.

    Description: I explored how poor encryption practices lead to data exposure. Simulated capturing credentials over HTTP instead of HTTPS and studied insecure storage of sensitive info in cookies and local storage.

Day 5 ‚Äì Insecure Design (A04:2021)

    Task: Learn about design flaws that lead to vulnerabilities.

    Description: I studied real-world scenarios where bad design logic (e.g., business logic flaws) led to privilege escalation. I documented examples from bug bounty reports and understood how prevention requires secure development life cycles.
